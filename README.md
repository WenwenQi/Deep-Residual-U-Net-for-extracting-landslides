# Deep-Residual-U-Net-for-extracting-landslides
> The Deep Residual U-Net is proposed based on the U-Net and the residual neural network (ResNet).<br>
> This work introduced a new deep learning approach designed to automatically identify landslides from very high spatial resolution (0.5 m) images. This proposed method was tested in Tianshui city, Gansu province, where a heavy rainfall triggered more than 10,000 landslides in August 2013. The method only used 3-band and achieved high performance (recall 88.5%, precision 63.5%) in this spatially heterogeneous region. The authors wish the landslide community could use this state-of-the-art method to aid landslide mappings. <br>
