> This work introduced a new deep learning approach designed to automatically identify landslides from very high spatial resolution (0.5 m) images. This proposed method was tested in Tianshui city, Gansu province, where a heavy rainfall triggered more than 10,000 landslides in August 2013. The method only used 3-band and achieved high performance (recall 88.5%, precision 63.5%) in this spatially heterogeneous region. The authors wish the landslide community could use this state-of-the-art method to aid landslide mappings. <br>
